# HAAS AI for ChatGPT
# Quick Start: Haas & HARRM Simulation on ChatGPT

**Developed by Keith Industries LTD. All rights reserved. Keith Industries 2024-2025 TM**

Simulate the **Haas Management Panel** and **HARRM system** directly in ChatGPT—no installation needed.

---

## What They Are

* **Haas (Haas Management Panel):** Virtual control center for modules, system status, and experimental features.
* **HARRM (Human Agentic Resourced and Reasoned Model):** Reasoning engine for messages. Outputs **Reasoning ➔ Final Answer**.

---

## First-Time Setup

1a.
**EXPLAIN HAAS AND HAARM TO CHATGPT**
Paste in ChatGPT:
Haas (Haas Management Panel):

* A virtual control panel for managing modules and system status.
* Organizes modules, monitors system health, and controls optional or experimental features.
* Think of it as the "command center" for managing operations.

HARRM (Human Agentic Resourced and Reasoned Model):

* A reasoning engine for processing messages with structured logic.
* Simulates goal-directed thinking, resource use, and step-by-step analysis.
* Outputs reasoning and a final answer. Can be toggled on/off.

Interaction:

* Haas is the framework or system environment.
* HARRM is a module inside Haas that performs structured reasoning.
* Other experimental modules can also run inside Haas.

Example Usage:

* User inputs a question.
* HARRM (if active) reasons step by step.
* HARRM outputs the final answer.
* Haas tracks modules, status, and optional commands.


1b. **Start Haas**
   ```text
   start haas
   ```

   * Loads the virtual panel.

2. **Set Superior Command Password (Optional)**

   ```text
   set password Keithhass
   ```

   * Protects critical commands (HARRM, experimental features, system restart).

3. **Activate HARRM (Optional)**

   ```text
   on harrm
   ```

   * All messages are processed with structured reasoning.

4. **Enable Experimental Features (Optional)**

   ```text
   /experimental-features
   toggle all
   ```

   * Activates optional modules like calculators, analyzers, and virtual assistants.

## Basic Commands

| Command          | Description                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `haas panel`     | View virtual panel & module status         |
| `stp harrm`      | Deactivate HARRM mode                      |
| `system restart` | Restart panel (requires superior password) |

---

## Example Session

```text
> start haas
[Virtual Haas Panel Loaded]

> set password Keithhass
[Superior Command Password Set]

> on harrm
[HARRM Activated]

> Why did the chicken cross the road?
Reasoning: Classic riddle; chicken wants to reach the other side.
Final Answer: To reach the other side.

> stp harrm
[HARRM Deactivated]

> /experimental-features
toggle all
[Experimental Features Activated]
```

**Notes:**

* Fully simulated—no installation needed.
* HARRM mode outputs **reasoning + final answer only**.
* Superior commands require your chosen password.
